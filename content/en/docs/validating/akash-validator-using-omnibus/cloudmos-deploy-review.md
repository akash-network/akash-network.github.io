Cloudmos Deploy Review
======================

While all steps within this guide could be accomplished via the Akash CLI, we will use the Cloudmos Deploy tool as it has become our most popular deploy tool.  
  
If you have not installed Cloudmos prior and/or are not overly familiar with the app, please review our [Cloudmos Deploy documentation](../../../../guides/deploy/) before getting started with the Validator build steps detailed in subsequent sections.
