Akash Deployments via Terraform
===============================

**Overview**
------------

Akash Deployments may now be launched and managed via Terraform!

Within this guide we will break down the deployment process using this new path.

We begin with a review of the [Terraform Manifest file components](terraform-manifest-template.md) and provide a [Full Manifest Example](terraform-manifest-complete-example.md) for additional clarity.

The following activities are possible currently via the Terraform Akash Provider:

*   [Deployment Create](create-akash-deployment.md)
*   [Deployment Close](close-akash-deployment.md)
