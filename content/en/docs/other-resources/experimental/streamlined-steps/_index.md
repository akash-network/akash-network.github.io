Streamlined Steps
=================

Akash CLI use has been streamlined in this guide. With the use of pre-defined environment variables, CLI commands are very concise.

For a more through review of the Akash CLI, including direct use of variables, visit the [CLI Detailed Steps](../mainnet4-upgrade-docs/detailed-steps/) guide.

### Akash Wants to Spotlight Your Work

Have an idea for a project to deploy on Akash? Already working on a project? Maybe youâ€™ve already deployed a project (or many projects!) to the network?

We love seeing what our community is building. Once your deployment is live, head over to our Discord and share the details of your app in our [Deployments channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/771909909335506955) and tag @Admin.

Once you share your app, someone from the Akash team may reach out to spotlight your app across our newsletter, blog, and social media.

This is a great opportunity to connect with the team at Akash Network and to spotlight your work for our world-class community.
