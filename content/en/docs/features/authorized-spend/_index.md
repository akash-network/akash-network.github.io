Authorized Spend
================

Authorized Spend allows users to authorize spend of a set number of tokens from a source wallet to a destination, funded wallet. The authorized spend is restricted to Akash deployment activities and the recipient of the tokens would not have access to those tokens for other operations. This allows large teams to work on deployments together without using large shared wallets, thereby reducing security concerns.
