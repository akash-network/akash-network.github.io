Praetor
=======

The Praetor application offers a streamlined mechanism to deploy an Akash Provider. The web app allows the creation of the necessary Kubernetes cluster and the Provider instance all from within an extremely user friendly series of guided steps.

In addition to the Praetor Provider build app, the team has created great tools for viewing current Akash Providers and a Provider revenue calculator.
