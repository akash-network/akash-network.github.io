Akash Provider Bid Pricing
==========================

In this guide we cover the use of a utility which calculates pricing used by an Akash Provider based on inputted server specifications.

Following a dry run of the Provider price script within this guide, the utility will be used within the execution of the provider build and will tune the providerâ€™s bin engine appropriately.
