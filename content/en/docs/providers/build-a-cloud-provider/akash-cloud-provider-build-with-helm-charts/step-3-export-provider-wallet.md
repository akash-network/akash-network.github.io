STEP 3 - Export Provider Wallet
===============================

In this section we will export the pre-existing, funded wallet to store the private key in a local file. To conduct the commands in this section the Akash CLI must be installed which is detailed in this [guide](../../../other-resources/experimental/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/detailed-steps/) (STEP 1 only).

The wallet used will be used for the following purposes:

*   Pay for provider transaction gas fees
*   Pay for bid collateral which is discussed further in this section

> Make sure to create a new Akash account for the provider and do not reuse an account used for deployment purposes. Bids will not be generated from your provider if the deployment orders are created with the same key as the provider.

List Available Keys
-------------------

*   Print the key names available in the local OS keychain for use in the subsequent step

    provider-services keys list
    

### Example/Expected Output

    provider-services keys list
    - name: ""
      type: local
      address: akash1<redacted>
      pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"<redacted>"}'
      mnemonic: ""
    - name: mykey
      type: local
      address: akash1<redacted>
      pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"<redacted>"}'
      mnemonic: ""
    

**Export Private Key to Local File**
------------------------------------

*   The key-name can be any name of your choice
*   Note the passphrase used to protect the private key as it will be used in future steps
