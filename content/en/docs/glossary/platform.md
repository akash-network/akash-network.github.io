Containers
==========

The **Akash Container Platform** is a deployment platform for hosting and managing [containers](broken-reference) where users can run _**any**_ Cloud-Native application. Akash is built with a set of cloud management services including [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) to orchestrate and manage containers.

### Containers

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A **container** **image** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

**Container images** become **containers** at runtime. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.
