# Akash Network Website

Sovereign Infrastructure that Scales

## Lead

Akash is an open network that lets users buy and sell computing resources securely and efficiently, purpose-built for public utility.

## You will own your cloud, and you will be happy

With Akash, you have the power to own your cloud. You can deploy your own cloud infrastructure, and you can sell your unused cloud resources to others. You can also buy cloud resources from others, and you can use them to run your applications.

## Supercloud at your fingertips, at a price you want to pay

Akash is the first commercial supercloud that lets you scale to hundreds of regions around the globe instantly without being locked into a single vendor.

Akash uses a reverse auction mechanism to price cloud resources where you say how much you want to pay and providers bid for your business, usually 75%-85% cheaper than the classic cloud can offer.

## Built for Battle, Governed by You

Akash is community-owned and community-run. It is a public utility, and it is open source. Build on solid container-native foundation with Kubernetes and Cosmos

Every aspect of Akash network is governed by the community in an open manner, which includes setting the road map to implementing a feature.
