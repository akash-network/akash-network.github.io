# Akash EDU

## What is Akash EDU?
Akash EDU is a free educational program designed to teach individuals basic to advanced knowledge of the Akash Network Ecosystem. We're starting off small by introducing a few courses one at a time giving students a better understanding of our ecosystem partners, eg -Cloudmos, Praetor and Terraform. We have a long term plan to add additional courses over time and eventually get to a place where students can become full fledged decentralized cloud professionals

Applications are reviewed bi-weekly and onboarding instructions are sent to new students on a rolling basis.
