# Akash Community



The Akash Network is supported by a diverse group of users, contributors, and supporters. We continually strive to improve the project and work together more efficiently. Our progress over time is something we're proud of. All aspects of the Akash Network - from code to culture - are managed by the community and divided into four programs.
