# Community Contributions

## What are Community Contributions?
The Akash community is global in its reach and enormous in its impact. However, due to the size and complexity in the ways members can contribute,
there is no central repository of all the content that's educating and inspiring current and future crypto community members. 

The below repository is designed for community members to add Akash educational content they've created for review. It's open to anyone that has developed Akash content.

[Guide on how to add your contributions](https://akash.network/community/contributionshowto/)

**DISCLAIMER:** The content below has been created by and for the Akash community. While each content piece goes through a lightweight approval process for quality assurance, it's highly suggested you DYOR.
