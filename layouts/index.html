      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Infrastructure as Code</h2>
        <p class="small"> Akash's orchestration layer is powered by SDL. This simple-to-use YAML-based language lets you 
          create complex deployments that span multiple areas and providers while choosing the resources you want to
           use and deciding on your price. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Kubernetes Powered</h2>
        <p class="small"> Akash runs on Kubernetes, the industry-leading container orchestration system. With this in
          place, you can rest assured that your applications will be hosted on a secure and reliable platform that has
          been tested and proven to work.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Persistent Storage </h2>
        <p class="small">Akash offers a limitless storage system that saves your data even after restarting. This is ideal for databases and programs that store large datasets.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Dedicated IP Leasing</h2>
        <p class="small"> Akash gives you the ability to rent a dedicated IP address for your application. This allows
          you to assign any port of your choice to your deployment, and then direct traffic towards it. This is
          especially useful for services such as DNS, web servers, and more.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Censorship Resistant and Unstoppable</h2>
        <p class="small"> Deploying applications on Akash is open to everyone, and is secure and censorship-proof.
          Nobody can stop you from using Akash to build apps that can't be censored.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5"> Pseudonymous and Non-attributable </h2>
        <p class="small"> The Akash protocol is designed to protect your identity, providing a high level of privacy and
          security. You can use it to deploy applications anonymously, without anyone knowing who you are.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Peer-to-peer and Private</h2>
        <p class="small"> You and the provider you're using to deploy your application communicate directly, without any
          external parties. This makes sure your data stays secure and private, and no one can claim a portion of your
          payments or keep track of what's happening. Furthermore, Akash's lack of central control makes it dependable
          and unaffected by single point of failure. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Layer One Protocol</h2>
        <p class="small"> Akash is a layer one protocol built using Cosmos SDK that uses Proof-of-Stake consensus to
          secure its network of decentralized validators. The network can be validated without permission and is secured
          by AKT, its native token. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Interoperable with IBC</h2>
        <p class="small"> Akash is the first blockchain to successfully carry out an Inter-Blockchain Communication
          (IBC) transaction with Cosmos Hub. This makes Akash able to communicate natively with other blockchains that
          are also IBC compatible. </p>
